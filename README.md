# Slimey
Slimey is a Slim 4 Skeleton that uses Slim PSR-7 implementation, PHP-DI container and Twig template engine. Slimey is more than just a Slim skeleton: it's a teeny tiny framework built on top of the Slim framework.

By default, Slim doesn't come with many tools/libraries you would require in a typical project. So Slimey gives you a skeleton that's already bundled with those―plus some useful global helper utilies―so you can start coding instantly.

# Installation
You would install Slimey just how you would do with any other skeleton. If you need elobration: (1) download this repo, (2) extract it to a folder, (3) `cd into/the/folder/`, (4) and run `composer install`; that's it! Make sure you configure it.

# Configuration
Slimey uses a dotenv file to store the configuration settings. A sample config is given in `./config/.env.sample`. You have to copy that file by running `cp ./config/.env.sample ./config/.env` from the root of the project. 

# Todo
